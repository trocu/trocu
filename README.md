<p>I am a graduate of a one-year Full Stack Web Developer course, where I gained solid programming fundamentals and experience in effective teamwork within IT environments. Since the beginning of the year, I have been collaborating with the software house Radioactive Rat Sp. z o.o., where I learned modern project approaches and expanded my knowledge of industry practices. My passion for programming, combined with hands-on experience, drives me to create visually appealing and highly functional web applications. I aim to merge creativity with technology, contributing to innovative and user-centric digital solutions.</p>
